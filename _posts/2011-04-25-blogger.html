So i just moved this blog to blogger from my wordpress blog. Having to update wordpress and the plugins all the time was annoying, and its not like I've been blogging much.<br /><br />I&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this tool for converting wordpress posts/comments into a blogger format.<br /><a href="http://wordpress2blogger.appspot.com/">http://wordpress2blogger.appspot.com/</a><br />It seems pretty good, although it did crash for me. I found out why and fixed it, submitted the bug report, i wonder how it'll be before they publish the fix.<br /><br />Thanks blogger people, this is a great product.
