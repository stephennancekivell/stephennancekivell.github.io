Part of my app requires extracting a date from the line of text. To do this I use a regular expression to pick the substring that has the date, then use a date format to parse it.<br /><br />Heres a screen shot my first version of getting that information. The user inputs both the regex and the date format.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MNymZ50ufhs/UPkuHrkxXqI/AAAAAAAAAbE/x3Sx0iGqeXo/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2013-01-19%2B00%253A10%253A22.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="81" src="/assets/2013-01-20-dont-make-me-think-1.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />After a while it became clear to me that the regex could be derived from the date format. Because each symbol in the date format maps to a symbol in the regex.<br /><br />Heres a my second version.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A_fw4SbTqhs/UPkvQSdR2VI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/mfRGki4D23U/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-01-19+00:10:42.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="70" src="/assets/2013-01-20-dont-make-me-think-Screenshot+from+2013-01-19+00:10:42.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />The last improvement I've made is to try work out what the date format is by guessing each format from a set of known formats. By doing this its possible you wont need to do anything, just click next.<br /><br />The app is no where near complete, if there is such a thing. But these small usability improvements make a big difference. Now when I have to do some manual testing, it takes a fraction of the time.<br /><br /><br />Heres &nbsp;a fantastic book&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Don_t_make_me_think.html?id=-PNSAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">Dont make me think</a>&nbsp;worth a read.
