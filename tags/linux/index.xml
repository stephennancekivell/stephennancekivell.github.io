      <description>A Ubuntu automatic update script with email notifications.
We all know that we should keep our systems up to date with security patches and whatnot. This is something that we&amp;nbsp;don&#39;t&amp;nbsp;thing about on desktop computers, our operating systems (windows/ubuntu) do it automatically for us, giving us popup notifications when these are ready.
But on servers we never log in to get those notifications, as long as things keep running we&amp;nbsp;don&#39;t&amp;nbsp;care. You may get hacked one day and become extra&amp;nbsp;vigilant&amp;nbsp;for a while, but&amp;nbsp;that&#39;s&amp;nbsp;not going to last, were all lazy.</description>

      <description>So&amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve&amp;nbsp;got this file server/torrent box running raid 5 with 5 discs ATM, but i &amp;nbsp;can add more disks to it when it gets full and have been doing so for the last year. Lately we&#39;ve been noticing terrible performance from it, like browsing a folder (over samba) could take about 30 seconds to load.
Looking into this i found that the files being downloaded slowly by the torrents are getting terribly&amp;nbsp;fragmented, &amp;nbsp;like, from filefrag</description>
