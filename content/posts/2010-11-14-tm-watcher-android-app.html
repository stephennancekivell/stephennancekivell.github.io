TM Watcher for Trademe.co.nz<br/><br/>TM Watcher checks auctions in your Trademe watchlist to see when any of their attributes change, then notify the user. This includes attributes like bid price, end date.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I've put alot more polish into this than ODW, it feels good. I figured out how to have it run something at boot, which has the effect of greatly simplifying the user controls improving the user experience, compared to that of ODW. I even got a friend and did some user experience testing :)
