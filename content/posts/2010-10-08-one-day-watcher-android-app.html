I finished/published version 1.0 of my first android app today. One Day Watcher.<br/><br/>This app automatically checks 1-day.co.nz for you, so you dont have to. It checks for keywords that you set, and gives you notification with the results.<br/><br/>Check it out at http://code.google.com/p/one-day-watcher/<br/><br/>or search for it on the Android Market.<br/><br/>It'll be interesting to see if many people find it useful.
