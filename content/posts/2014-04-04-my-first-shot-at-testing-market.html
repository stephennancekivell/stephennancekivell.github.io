One day I want to start a online business, to sell some software as a service or something. Im not sure what yet, but when I do I'll need to do some marketing. I've never really done that.<br /><br />You cant have a business without customers, you cant have customers without marketing.<br /><br />So I decided to try testing a simple marketing strategy, Adwords. I put up a simple website, a fake online store that sold nuts, an existing market, something I knew people already wanted. It might be easy to penetrate this market. Of course I didn't actually have any almonds or walnuts to sell, the website just led through a fake checkout then to a "out of stock" page. I bought Adwords and watched the analytics in hope.<br /><br />From this experiment I've learnt that marketing is hard, Adwords are expensive, click through drop off rates are brutal. Its dawned on me is that I want to be better at design. If I were to really make a business, I would want the website design to be top notch, attractive, with current style.<br /><br />I know that when I compare products I'm very judgemental about the design of the landing page. I'll assume that because a website 'looks good' the product must be good. Other people must be the same.<br /><br />Im now doing an online design course by teamtreehouse. Im not sure how much a better design would give me better click throughs, but I know I want it.
