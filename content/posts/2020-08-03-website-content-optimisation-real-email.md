In Real Email I added a faq section as a way for users to drill into content. This hopefully allows the user to answer the question, but the real win is that it allows me to see what questions people feel are important and un-answered.

You can track usage of in a FAQ by setting up analytic events or using a screen caputure tool like hotjar.
