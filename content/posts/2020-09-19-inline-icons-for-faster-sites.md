As we strive for faster and faster websites

Having a fast website is imporant not only for user experience but also for SEO. In this post we inline some icons and to remove a css and font dependency, font-awesome.

On this blog I have a few social icons, these were built with font awesome. But thats about all I used it for. So im going to remove it and increase the speed of the site. If I used it for more, I might keep it.
