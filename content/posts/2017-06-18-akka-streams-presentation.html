# What are streams

* scala.collection.Stream
* Java 8 streams
* Spark streaming
* kafka streaming, AWS kinesis, google pub sub
* ActiveMQ and friends
* iterator

# Properties of streams

* infinite data
* cant fit in memory
* processed item by item


can perform many collection operations
* map
* filter

cant perform
* exists
* size

# Producers Consumers

```scala
Producer ~> B ~> C ~> Consumer
```

# Producers Consumers

```scala
Producer ~> B ~> C ~> Consumer
```


akka terminology
```scala
Source ~> Flow ~> Sink
```

# Push or Pull

---

# Push

.center[.w100[![push](/assets{{ page.id }}/push1.jpg)]]

---

# Push

* drop
* overflow
* block
* retry

---

# Pull

.center[.w100[![pull](/assets{{ page.id }}/pull.jpg)]]

---

# Pull

* twice the latency
* polling

---

# Dealing with Rate

---

# Back Pressure

.center[.w100[![back-pressure](/assets{{ page.id }}/back-pressure.jpg)]]

---

# Akka Streams

Dynamic Push Pull

Communicates demand

# Akka Streams

Fast consumer effectively push

Slow consumer effectively pull

---

# Reactive Streams

reactive-streams.org

Is a interface project. Not an implementation.

Joint effort between different groups in industry.

Lightbend, Netflix, Pivotal, Red Hat, Twitter, Oracle, ...

# Reactive Streams

* Java 9 flow
* rxJava
* slick(Relational database)
* reactive mongodb driver
* reactive kafka
* akka streams
* fs2 (formerly scalaz-streams)
* swave

and more

# Akka Streams 

```scala
Source ~> Flow ~> Sink
```

Reusable pieces

Lazy

---

# Hello world

```scala
  implicit val system = ActorSystem()
  implicit val mat = ActorMaterializer()

  val out: Future[Done] =
    Source(List(1, 2, 3))
      .map(x => x * x)
      .filter(_ > 3)
      .runWith(Sink.foreach(s => println(s)))
```

---

# Akka Streams Functions

```scala
Flow[A]
  .map(x => fn(x))
  .filter(_ > 2)
  .mapConcat(item => makeBatch(item): Seq[?])
  .mapAsync(parallelism = 2)(item => makeFuture(item): Future[?])
```

---

# Akka Streams Functions

```scala
Flow[A]
  .grouped(10)
  .groupedWithin(10, 1.second)
  .sliding(5,1)
```

---

# Akka Streams Functions

```scala
Flow[A]
  .buffer(100, OverflowStrategy.dropHead)
  .throttle(elements = 10, per = 1.second,
            maximumBurst = 5, mode = ThrottleMode.Shaping)
```

---

# Non Linear Streams

```scala 
  in ~> f1 ~> bcast ~> f2 ~> merge ~> f3 ~> out
              bcast ~> f4 ~> merge

```

---

# Graph DSL

```scala
RunnableGraph.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit builder: GraphDSL.Builder[NotUsed] =>
  import GraphDSL.Implicits._
  val in = Source(1 to 10)
  val out = Sink.ignore
 
  val bcast = builder.add(Broadcast[Int](2))
  val merge = builder.add(Merge[Int](2))
 
  val f1, f2, f3, f4 = Flow[Int].map(_ + 10)
 
  in ~> f1 ~> bcast ~> f2 ~> merge ~> f3 ~> out
              bcast ~> f4 ~> merge
              
  ClosedShape
})
```

Graph can be treated as a flow.
